## Summary

At North Star Sharing we aim to bring the furthest reaches of the vast riches from outer space
within reach one picture at a time! Weather you love to capture beautiful long exposer photos of the
night sky, or the highly technical imagines produced by telescopes like The Giant Magellan Telescope
weâ€™ve got you covered. Easily share the captivating imagines you take alongside with the Celestial
Coordinates to a community of fellow gazers! Explore other members photos and find them for yourself
with the attached coordinates and help from your phone to point you in the right direction.

> TODO: 1 or more paragraphs summarizing your aims or motivations for selecting the given topic for
> your app. That is, why did you choose to develop this particular app, and why is this (at least
> potentially) a useful or interesting app?

After signing in, users will be able to take pictures of celestial objects and attach tags for easy
categorization and searching. A user's own pictures will be displayed in a social media-style feed.
Users may search for pictures of specific celestial objects from a robust list of available tags.
Using a tag, a user may locate a celestial object using their camera, and the app will point them
to the correct patch of night sky. (The heavens await!)
